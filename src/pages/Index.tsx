Systematic Approach\n- Break down complex interactions\n- Consider logical flow and interdependencies\n- Create hierarchical structures\n- Account for potential failure points\n\n3. Perspective Considerations\n- Who would be implementing this system?\n- What resources are available?\n- What are the primary goals?\n- What cultural/technological limitations exist?\n\n4. Documentation Strategy\n- Use clear, structured language\n- Include diagrams or flowcharts\n- Provide rationale for design choices\n- Anticipate potential questions/challenges\n\n5. Iterative Development\n- Test theoretical components\n- Refine based on discovered insights\n- Maintain flexibility in design\n\nWould you like me to elaborate on any of these points for your project?
